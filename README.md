# Our Own Ready Mix — App

Real, running codebase (not a mockup). This is phase 1 of the actual build.

## What's working right now
- **Database schema** (`backend/schema.sql`) — every table for all 7 roles, including
  Pump, Fuel, Reports data, and audit trail (the gaps we flagged, already designed in,
  even though their screens aren't built yet).
- **Backend API** (`backend/`) — sign-in, Order creation, Delivery Ticket creation with
  full Trip Status Timeline logging, Driver duty toggle + GPS ping ingestion, trip
  allowance auto-payout on completed delivery only, breakdown/fuel reporting, Plant QC,
  Site QC with reject-concrete flow, invoicing based on rate master, and payments
  supporting multiple receipts per invoice.
- **Frontend** (`frontend/`) — installable Progressive Web App (PWA), works offline for
  the Driver and Site Supervisor screens (queues actions locally, syncs automatically
  once back online), sign-in page, role-based routing for all 7 roles.
- **All 7 roles fully wired end-to-end**: Driver, Manager, Site Supervisor, Plant
  Operator/QC, Accountant, and Administrator (user management + master data: customers,
  sites, trucks, rates). Each was tested against a real database with full pipeline
  tests before being handed over, including role-security checks (e.g. confirming a
  Driver account cannot reach Administrator or Accountant routes).

## What's not built yet
Pump module, Fuel module, and the 12 Reports — schema is ready (see `schema.sql`),
screens are not. These were flagged in the original requirements gap analysis and
intentionally deferred.

A few smaller items also noted during the build, worth knowing about:
- Manager "approve rejected concrete" step isn't wired (rejections currently just notify
  the Manager, without a formal approval action)
- Site temperature isn't captured at the Site Supervisor step (only slump is)
- No audit-trail UI yet, though the underlying `audit_log` table exists in the schema
- Disabling a user takes effect on their next login; a currently-logged-in session
  isn't force-ended immediately (their token remains valid until it expires, up to 30 days)

## How to run this yourself

You'll need:
1. A PostgreSQL database. Any cloud provider works — Render, Railway, Supabase, or a
   Google Cloud / AWS managed database all offer free or low-cost starter tiers.
2. Node.js installed on whatever machine you're developing from (v18 or newer).

### Backend
```
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # then fill in your real DATABASE_URL and a random JWT_SECRET
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f schema.sql     # creates all the tables
node src/seed.js            # creates your first Administrator login
npm start
```
The seed script prints a phone number and password you can use to sign in immediately —
change that password as soon as you're in.

### Frontend
```
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # point VITE_API_URL at your backend's address
npm run dev                 # for local testing
npm run build                # for deploying the real, installable app
```

### Deploying for real use
The `frontend/dist` folder (after `npm run build`) can be hosted on any static hosting
service (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages — many have free tiers). The `backend` folder
needs a Node.js hosting service (Render, Railway, Fly.io are common, simple choices).
None of this requires an Apple/Google developer account — it's a website your team opens
in their phone browser and adds to their home screen.

## Fixes from first round of real-world testing

After the team tried this with real orders, several issues came back and were fixed:

1. **Administrator can now correct or cancel orders and delivery tickets** — under
   "Correct orders" / "Correct tickets" in the Administrator screen. Nothing is ever
   hard-deleted (matches the SRS's "no permanent deletion" rule) — cancelling just
   excludes a record from active workflows while keeping it on file.
2. **All 10 mix grades added** (M7.5 through M50), and the seeding logic was fixed so
   adding grades in the future won't silently skip if some already exist.
3. **Pumping charge is now a flat lump sum per delivery**, not per m³ — this was a
   genuine schema change (`rate_master.pumping_charge_lumpsum`), applied automatically
   via migration when you next run `/setup`.
4. **Driver's "Report breakdown" and "Report fuel filling" now actually work** — they
   previously failed silently with no error shown. Both now open a proper form and
   show a clear confirmation or error message.
5. **Manager dashboard now shows delivered quantity** against each order's ordered
   quantity, not just the ordered amount.
6. **Orders now let you pick a specific pump** (e.g. "Line-2"), not just a pump type —
   Administrator can manage the list of pumps under "Pumps".
7. **Plant Operator and QC Engineer are fully separate screens now**, each with their
   own login and only their own actions available (`/plant-operator` vs `/qc`).
8. **Manager dashboard shows live GPS links** per active truck (opens the location in
   Google Maps) alongside the restored "Active trucks" table from the original mockup.
9. **Site Supervisor improvements**:
   - Added an "after-pour care" checklist item (e.g. covering with plastic sheet) and
     a comments field for notes about each supply
   - Fixed a real bug where the screen didn't refresh after tapping a button — it now
     also auto-refreshes every 15 seconds in case another role changes the ticket status

Also fixed along the way: a rate-lookup bug where having two rates on file for the same
day picked the wrong one, and the server no longer crashes entirely if one request hits
a database error (it now fails just that one request and stays up for everyone else).
